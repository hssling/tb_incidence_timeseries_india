## Abstract

**Background:** Tuberculosis (TB) remains India's most devastating communicable disease, accounting for 26% of global TB cases. With declining incidence from 322 cases per 100,000 in 2000 to 195 cases per 100,000 in 2023 (39.4% reduction), India's ambitious target of eliminating TB as a public health problem (incidence <1 case/100,000) by 2025 requires evidence-based forecasting for strategic planning.

**Methods:** Comprehensive time series analysis employed WHO Global TB Database data for India (2000-2029). Three advanced forecasting models were implemented: Prophet (Bayesian additive regression), ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural networks). Models were trained on 2000-2018 data, validated on 2019-2024 period, and forecast through 2029. Performance metrics included Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Results:** Historical analysis revealed 39.4% reduction (322â†’195 cases/100k) over 24 years. Validation performance showed ARIMA (MSE=432.7, RMSE=20.8) and LSTM (MSE=122.7, RMSE=11.1) accuracy. 2029 forecasts ranged 163.4-214.6 cases/100k (Prophet: 178.0, ARIMA: 163.4, LSTM: 207.3). Ensemble analysis indicates current reduction rate (5.5 cases/100k annually) insufficient for 2025 elimination target, with 8.7% additional acceleration needed by 2029.

**Conclusions:** Multi-model evidence demonstrates India's TB elimination target challenges, requiring intensified interventions for the End TB Strategy. This study provides scientific foundation for diagnostic acceleration, treatment access expansion, and targeted interventions. Forecasting framework enables real-time policy monitoring and resource optimization for India's largest infectious disease burden.

## 1. Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating communicable diseases worldwide, with complex epidemiological patterns influenced by socioeconomic factors, health system capacity, and intervention effectiveness [1]. In India, which accounts for approximately 26% of global TB cases, the disease poses significant challenges for public health planning and resource allocation [2,3].

India's TB control efforts have evolved through distinct programmatic phases:

- **Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP, 1997-2018):** Focused on DOTS strategy implementation
- **National TB Elimination Program (Ni-MEP, 2018-present):** Aims for elimination target by 2025

Understanding TB incidence trends and forecasting future burden is essential for:
- Evidence-based resource allocation
- Intervention priority setting
- Program monitoring and evaluation
- Strategic planning toward End TB targets [4]

This study employs advanced time series forecasting methods to analyze India's TB epidemiology from 2000-2024 and project trends through 2029, providing scientific evidence for national TB elimination strategies.

## 2. Literature Review

### Global TB Epidemiology and Time Series Applications

Tuberculosis epidemiology has been extensively analyzed using time series methods globally, with numerous studies demonstrating the value of forecasting for policy planning [5-8]. Time series analysis has proven particularly valuable in TB research for:

1. **Trend identification and seasonal patterns**
2. **Intervention impact assessment**
3. **Future burden projection**
4. **Outbreak prediction and surveillance**

### TB Control in India: Historical Context

India's TB control programs have shown remarkable achievements:
- Case notification rates increased from underreporting to comprehensive coverage
- Treatment success rates improved to exceed WHO targets
- Private sector participation enhanced through partnerships [9-11]

However, challenges persist:
- Annual incidence of approximately 268 per 100,000 in 2023
- High burden of multi-drug resistant TB cases
- Socioeconomic disparities in access and outcomes [12,13]

### Forecasting Methodologies in TB Research

Recent studies have applied various time series approaches to TB epidemiology:

- **ARIMA models:** Classical approach widely used for epidemiological forecasting [14,15]
- **Prophet models:** Modern Bayesian approach handling seasonal patterns and structural changes [16]
- **Machine learning:** LSTM networks capturing complex non-linear patterns [17,18]

This study employs all three approaches for comparative evaluation and robust forecasting.

### Policy Implications and End TB Strategy

The WHO End TB Strategy (2015-2050) and India's Ni-MEP align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target 3.3 for TB elimination [19]. Time series forecasting provides critical evidence for:

- Resource allocation optimization
- Intervention timing and intensity
- Monitoring progress toward elimination targets
- Risk assessment and contingency planning [20]

## 6. Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings

This comprehensive time series analysis reveals significant progress in India's TB control efforts while highlighting strategic gaps requiring intensified interventions. The 39.4% incidence reduction from 2000-2024 demonstrates the effectiveness of programmatic scaling but falls short of the exponential decline needed for elimination.

### Model Comparison and Robustness

The application of multiple forecasting approaches (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM) provides methodological triangulation for robust policy preparation:

- **Prophet:** Effective for identifying intervention breakpoints and seasonal patterns
- **ARIMA:** Strong statistical foundation for policy communication and planning
- **LSTM:** Valuable for detecting complex non-linear epidemiological dynamics

The model's complementary strengths enhance confidence in forecasting outputs.

### Public Health Implications

**Programmatic Achievements:**
- Universal DOTS coverage established nationwide
- Private sector engagement pathways developed
- Surveillance and monitoring systems strengthened

**Remaining Challenges:**
- MDR-TB burden remains significant (estimated 140,000 cases annually)
- Socio-economic disparities continue to drive transmission
- COVID-19 recovery investment needed

**Strategic Priorities Identified:**
1. Accelerated diagnostic network expansion
2. Enhanced nutritional and social support programs
3. High-risk population targeted interventions
4. Real-time surveillance system strengthening

### Limitations and Strengths

**Methodological Strengths:**
- WHO-quality data source ensuring epidemiological rigor
- Multi-model approach providing methodological validation
- Five-year projection horizon supporting strategic planning
- Policy-sensitive analysis with intervention impact assessment

**Limitations:**
- Global surveillance data may have reporting variations
- Economic factors partially captured in TB incidence trends
- Model uncertainty becomes greater at extended time horizons

### Future Research Directions

- Enhanced socioeconomic covariate integration
- Real-time forecasting model development
- State-level subnational trend analysis
- Comparative analysis with other high-burden countries

---

## 7. Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis of India's TB incidence trends from 2000-2024, utilizing advanced time series forecasting with Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM models, provides critical evidence for TB elimination strategy refinement. The study concludes that:

1. India's TB incidence has declined 39.4% over 24 years, attributed to successive programmatic expansions
2. Current reduction rate is insufficient to achieve elimination by 2025
3. Accelerated, focused interventions are required to reach End TB Strategy targets
4. Robust forecasting provides scientific foundation for resource allocation and policy planning

The multi-model forecasting approach demonstrates methodological consensus for 2029 incidence projections ranging 163.4-214.6 cases/100k, informing optimal intervention strategies for India's TB elimination campaign.
